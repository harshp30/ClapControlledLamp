A project that originally started off with a led, and later inetgrated with a lamp. The system works like a clap lamp. 
The user claps twice (200 milliseconds apart) and a microphone sensor (DAOKI) which then read those values and sends them too the arduino. 
The arduino then sends that signal to a relay (TE213) that controls the led/lamp. Implementing the system into a lmap 
came with some minor challenges such as creating one seamless piece instead of the lmap and arduino completely seprated.
To fix this issue I pushed everything into the lamp and placed the lamp on a plastic container that I cut small slits into for the microphone sound sensor and the arduino power cable.

Challenges:

For this project the tougher part was the hardware. Arranging eveyrthing into the base of the lamp was a bit challenging.
The softwrae also had a few challenegs, one of them being having to create a time delay between the two claps to make sure no random sounds turn on the lamp.

Lessons:

This was great software hardware that let me work with relays and also allowing me to apply a project to a pre-existing object (in this case the lamp).
It makes a bit trickier to make a project around something physical rather than from scratch.

Possible Improvements:

Two ways I could have imporved the lamp is by making the ystsem more portable for the easy of moving it and my concealing some sort of coating around the lamp
to make the hardware less visible.
